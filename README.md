# Angular Metrics Playground

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.0. Install the dependencies locally with `npm install`. You should have `nvm` installed and you should be using the most recent LTS version (currently `node v18.14.2` and `npm 9.5.0`).

## Running the

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. If you don't have or don't want to use the global installation of the `@angular/cli` just run `npx ng serve --open`. All other angular (ng) commands need to be preceded by `npx`, to refer the local installation.

## Running the other project components

Run `docker compose up -d` in the root directory to start the other project components (Matomo and MySQL).
